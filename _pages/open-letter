Hello! 

Thank you for your interest in joining my research program. I’d like to share my mentorship approach and what you can expect if we work together. 

My educational path has been shaped by both challenges and affirmations. As a child, I learned early how rigid learning environments can discourage curiosity. It wasn’t until I had the chance to represent young learners at an international summit that I felt the power of being heard. That experience gave me the courage to pursue graduate studies where I found mentorship that blended academic rigor with empathy, high expectations with patience, predictability, and unwavering support. The guidance and trust I received, especially the space to make mistakes and grow from them, deeply informs how I support my mentees. 

I believe effective mentorship is more than academic supervision. It is a partnership rooted in mutual respect, clear communication, and shared purposes. I support mentees in becoming life-long learners who think critically, act ethically, and approach challenges with creativity and care. I value diverse perspectives and life experiences, and I welcome mentees from all backgrounds, especially those whose lived experiences are not widely reflected in academic settings. 

Each professional stage brings different challenges. You can expect a working environment that is structured and tailored to your goals, needs, and stage of training and development, where all questions are welcome, and mistakes are part of the process. I also view mentorship as a two-way street. As each person grows intellectually and as collaborations develop, the ways we contribute to each other’s learning and progress may evolve, sometimes symmetrically, sometimes asymmetrically, with mutual respect and openness. 

Whether I serve as your primary supervisor or as a member of your committee, I am approachable, reliable, and respectful of your goals and time. In the primary supervisor capacity, I provide ongoing guidance on research design, writing, professional development, and career planning. We’ll meet regularly, co-develop milestones, and troubleshoot challenges together. As a committee member, I provide critical feedback, additional expertise, and support your growth from a complementary angle. Although I may be less involved in daily logistics, I remain invested in your success and welcome your questions and updates. 

No matter the path my mentees choose, academia, industry, public service, or others, I want them to leave their training program feeling confident, courageous, and prepared. To that end, I expect my mentees to be curious, collaborative, and proactive. Expectations vary by training stage, and growth across levels is always encouraged. Throughout, I emphasize that sustainable progress requires both focused effort and mindful rest. 

* Undergraduate students are expected to focus on cultivating curiosity, asking thoughtful questions, and developing strong critical thinking foundations, while having the space to explore higher-level skills when they are ready.  

* Graduate students are expected to take increasing ownership of their work, engage deeply with the literature, and position their projects within broader scientific and societal contexts, with support to continue developing their core skills. 

* Postdoctoral researchers are expected to operate with substantial intellectual independence, helping to shape the group’s research direction while engaging in ongoing learning and mentorship. 

If you’re looking for a research environment that values thoughtfulness, collaboration, and a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, or if you believe my expertise would complement your supervisory team, I invite you to reach out via email. To make the most of our exchange, please prioritize specific, relevant inquiries that demonstrate genuine interest. Given the volume of requests, I can only respond to inquiries that are relevant to my role.
