This page will be updated as research opportunities become available. 

**Funded Positions:** At this time, I am available to supervise students and trainees who currently hold substantial financial aid. Available positions for funded projects from my program will be listed at <https://hnguyen19.github.io/current/>.  

**Honors Theses & Applied Master's Projects**: I also welcome honors thesis and applied master's students working on required research projects. While funding is not available for these positions, I provide strong mentorship and support to help students develop research skills and complete high-quality work. I'm also happy to help students apply for external funding opportunities.

**External Funding Support:** I encourage prospective mentees to explore the scholarships and fellowships listed by McGill's Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies Office at <https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/funding/opportunities>. If you identify a financial aid program and are interested in working with me, I strongly encourage you to reach out as early as possible, ideally 6-12 months before the application deadline, so we can discuss project details and prepare a strong application together. For timely preparation, please also consult the graduate application deadlines and other relevant informaation at <https://www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/how-apply/you-apply-mcgill/application-deadlines>
